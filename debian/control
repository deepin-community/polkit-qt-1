Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libpolkit-qt5-1-1 (= ${binary:Version}), qtbase5-dev, ${misc:Depends}
Description: PolicyKit-qt5-1 development files
 PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 .
 It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
 granting access to privileged operations (like calling the HAL Mount() method)
 for unprivileged (desktop) applications.
 .
 libpolkit-qt5-1 provides convenience classes and methods for Qt 5/KDE
 applications that want to use PolicyKit-1.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries and headers for the Qt 5
 version.
